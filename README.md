Modeling the wealth of a population through a set of coupled ODE's.

Each "decile" (can also be a much smaller group) produces a certain amount of wealth. Of this wealth, a certain amount is given directly to producers as "wages", while the rest is redirected to the pool of investment income.

A bifurcation is observed. If investment income is merely distributed at a certain rate, roughly even outcomes emerge.

If having more wealth gives too much of an advantage in returns on investment, a "winner takes all" dynamic emerges. This dynamic can lead to a large reduction in the population's total wealth as lower groups no longer have sufficient wealth to produce efficiently.

This transition exhibits hysteresis. Just revoking the wealth advantage again does not result in a return to equity; the established winner continues to take all. Additional "redistributional" rules (giving a flat return from the investment pool to each group, or even preferential distributions to low wealth groups) are necessary.
